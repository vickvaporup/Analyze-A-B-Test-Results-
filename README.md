# Analyze-A-B-Test-Results

Analyze A/B Test Results Project

Description 

This project is one of the projects for the Udacity Data Analysis Nonodegree program. Itâ€™s purpose is to understand the results of an A/B Test run by an e-commerce website. The goal is to  help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
Some of the imported libraries for this project were pandas, numpy, random, matplotlib.
